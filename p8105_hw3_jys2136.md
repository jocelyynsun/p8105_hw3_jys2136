# Problem 1

## Instacart Data

#### Most popular aisles and number of ordered items

``` r
data("instacart")

# Finding the number of aisles in instacart:
n_aisle = 
  instacart %>%
  count(aisle) %>%
  arrange(desc(n))


# Looking at the first few rows of data to see which aisles(s) are the most items ordered from:
head(n_aisle, 5)
```

    ## # A tibble: 5 × 2
    ##   aisle                           n
    ##   <chr>                       <int>
    ## 1 fresh vegetables           150609
    ## 2 fresh fruits               150473
    ## 3 packaged vegetables fruits  78493
    ## 4 yogurt                      55240
