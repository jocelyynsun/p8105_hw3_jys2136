# Problem 1

## Instacart Data

``` r
data("instacart")

# Finding the number of aisles in instacart:
n_aisle = 
  instacart %>%
  count(aisle) %>%
  arrange(desc(n))


# Looking at the first few rows of data to see which aisles(s) are the most items ordered from:
head(n_aisle, 5)
```

    ## # A tibble: 5 × 2
    ##   aisle                           n
    ##   <chr>                       <int>
    ## 1 fresh vegetables           150609
    ## 2 fresh fruits               150473
    ## 3 packaged vegetables fruits  78493
    ## 4 yogurt                      55240
    ## 5 packaged cheese             41699

#### Data description

The data set “instacart” has has 15 variables and 1384617 observations.

There are 134 aisles and as we can see in the output provided above. The
aisles where the most items are ordered from are “fresh vegetables” and
“fresh fruits”.

#### Visualizing the number of items ordered in each aisle

Make a table showing the three most popular items in each of the aisles
“baking ingredients”, “dog food care”, and “packaged vegetables fruits”.
Include the number of times each item is ordered in your table.

Make a table showing the mean hour of the day at which Pink Lady Apples
and Coffee Ice Cream are ordered on each day of the week; format this
table for human readers (i.e. produce a 2 x 7 table).
